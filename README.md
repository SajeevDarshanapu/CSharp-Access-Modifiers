# CSharp-Access-Modifiers

1) The 'public' keyword is an access modifier which is used to set access level to class,fields,properties and methods
2) It is used to control the visibility of class members
3) To achieve Encapsulation(The process of making sure that sensitive data is hidden from users),this is done by declaring fields as private.
4) We can develop re-usable applications with less code and less develpoment time
5) The default scope for members of a class are private.
